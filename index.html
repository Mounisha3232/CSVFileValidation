<title>VALIDATION OF A CSV</title>


<h1 style="color:white">VALIDATION OF CSV FILE</h1>
<h2  style="color: white">Upload a csv file which you want to evaluate and use for your 
project.</h2>
<h3  style="color: white"> Here we will check for
<ul> <li> Null values</li>
<li> Fill null values</li>
<li>Data type pediction</li>
<li> Label encoding </li>
<li>Predict duplicate value</li>
<li>Remove duplicate values</li>
<li> OneHot encoding (if needed)</li>
<li> Feature scaling (if needed)</li>
 and after all these is done u can get the csv which is 
 ready to use for your project</ul></h3>
 
<h3  style="color: white"> Do you want to do OneHot Encoding and Feature Scaling?</h3>
<h3  style="color: white"> Remember if you do this you data will be in binary format,
which is not understandable by humans.</h3> 
<form action = "/login" method=post enctype=multipart/form-data>
<input id="csvFileInput" type="file" name="f1" accept=".csv"/>

<label for = "s">Choose your option</label>
<select name = "s">
<option value = "Yes">Yes</option>
<option value = "No">No</option>
<input type=submit value=Upload>

<p style="color: white"> FOR REFFRENCE:</P>
<h3  style="color: white">Null Value :</h3>
<p>A NULL value in a table is a value in a 
field that appears to be blank. It is very important to understand 
that a NULL value is different than a zero value or a field that 
contains spaces. And here we will try to fill the null value with 
MODE value. The mode of a set of data values is the value that appears
 most often.</p>
 <h3 style="color: white">Data Type Pediction</h3>
 <p>
 A data type, in programming, is a classification that specifies 
 which type of value a variable has and what type of mathematical, 
 relational or logical operations can be applied to it without causing
  an error. A string, for example, is a data type that is used to 
  classify text and an integer is a data type used to classify 
  whole numbers. So here we also predict the data type for each column heading.</p>
<h3 style="color: white"> Label Encoding</h3>
<p>
 Label encoding is to convert the textual data form to numerical form.
  It is an important pre-processing step for the structured dataset 
  in supervised learning. It helps us in giving different value for 
  each and every value. label encoding is important because our spyder 
  or jupyter notebook will not accept textual data so if the data is converted
  then it will be easy for the user to get the output as required.</P>
 <h3 style="color: white">Predict Duplicate Value</h3>
 <p>
  Predicting duplicate value is also important so that our dataset is so 
  clear with all needed or important information. Sometimes it happens 
  that we enter some data twice or many times so it is not nessaceary to 
  run the epochs all the time so by predicting and deleting it we are
  making the csv with all short and important data.</p>
 <h3 style="color: white">OneHot Encoding</h3>
 <p>
  One hot encoding is a process by which categorical variables are 
  converted into a form that could be provided to ML algorithms to do 
  a better job in prediction. The categorical value represents the 
  numerical value of the entry in the dataset. As the number of unique
   entries increases, the categorical values also proportionally 
   increases. the categorical values start from 0 goes all the way 
   up to N-1 categories. 0 indicates non existent while 1 indicates 
   existent. </P>
   <h3 style="color: white">Feature Scaling</h3>
   <p>
   Feature Scaling is a technique to standardize the independent 
   features present in the data in a fixed range. It is performed 
   during the data pre-processing. In data processing, it is
    also known as data normalization and is generally performed 
    during the data preprocessing step. In this all the value of the 
    colunm are ranged between some values.</p>
